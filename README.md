# hack4no
Participation entry in international 36h hackathon near Oslo (Norway). 
This was meant to be a prototype iOS application - **only developed in 2 days**.
Award for "Best Coding".

## Vision
We wanted to create a mobile app, which analyses the free meteorological data in Norway, in order to create a recommendation system on where to go (in your region) to have the best chances to see the northern lights.
